## Malware Analysis
- study of malware behavior
- analyze a suspicious binary file in a sandbox environment
- identify malware properties and type - RAT,HTTP bot, spam bot, rootkit, keylogger?
- control server IP/Domain
- Does it create an registry key in the system? can we use the key as a malware ID?- search for remediation
- find out the hash of malware file

## Types of Malware Analysis
1. Static analysis - review binary file, do not execute
2. Dynamic analysis / Behavioral analysys - execute in a sandbox environment
3. Code analysis - static and dynamic code analysis
4. Memory analysis / Memory forensics - analyze ram of the host machine

# Hexeditor
## file extensions (not reliable) vs file signature (more reliable)
- you can use hexeditor to locate unique file signature
- .exe, .dll, .com, .drv, .sys file has this signature: hexadecimal characters 4D 5A in first two bytes

- xxd -g 1 filename.extension | head -5
- https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388 - for windows system, more advanced than HxD
- for linux use file command to check for filetype

# Hash generators
- Windows: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html
- md5sum, sha56sum, sha1sum
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#simple-hashing
- 

# Find Strings
- use string command in linux
- https://github.com/cloudsecuritylabs/flare-floss 

# Packers and Cryptors
- Packer - use compression to obfuscate file, then pack it inside another executable
- Cryptor - use encryption to obfuscate file, then pack it inside anotehr executable
- Free packer program - https://upx.github.io/
