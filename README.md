# Hexeditor
## file extensions (not reliable) vs file signature (more reliable)
- you can use hexeditor to locate unique file signature
- .exe, .dll, .com, .drv, .sys file has this signature: hexadecimal characters 4D 5A in first two bytes

- xxd -g 1 filename.extension | head -5

- for linux use file command to check for filetype
